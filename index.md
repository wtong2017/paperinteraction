While printing visualizations on paper, such as in newspapers, textbooks, and promotion leaflets, is a common way to share insights, this medium is inherently static and unable to support interactive data exploration. By adding a dynamic digital layer on top of printed visualizations, Augmented Reality (AR) provides opportunities to bring interactivity to those visualizations. However, interacting with this digital layer can be challenging as it does not provide direct physical affordances, such as touch or tangibility. Paper, on the other hand, is a ubiquitous and affordable medium with natural tangibility and inherent physical flexibility for direct manipulation.

To understand the affordances and the design space of utilizing paper as a tangible user interface to provide interactivity, this project reports on multiple workshop sessions with 20 researchers in visualization and Human-Computer Interaction and then describes a design space of paper interactions (e.g., fold, flip, tilt) and data exploration operations (e.g., select, zoom, pan). 

To access the practical viability of the interaction-operation pairs identified in the workshop, we built an experimental prototype and conducted a user study with 12 participants evaluating each pair and exploring data using paper interactions. This project concludes with a list of recommendations for designing effective interaction for augmented paper visualizations.
